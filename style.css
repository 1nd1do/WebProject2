/* Color Scheme Explanation:

1. The background color is a light blue (#87cefa). I chose this color because it’s calm and easy on the eyes. Blue is also a color that makes people feel relaxed and happy.

2. For the text, I used a darker color (#333333) so it's easy to read. Dark text stands out better against the light blue background.

3. The headings (h2) is light gray (#464040). This helps make the headings stand out but still keeps the design soft and not too bright, making it easier to look at.

4. For links, I picked a soft blue (#5f9ea0) instead of a really bright blue. It’s easy to see but not too strong. When you hover over the link, it turns yellow (#ffcc00), which looks nice and gives a cool effect.

5. The footer is a bit darker blue (#6495ed), so it’s different from the rest of the page but still matches the blue theme.

6. I used yellow for the link hover and focus outline so it’s easy to see when you click or focus on a link. This helps people navigate the website better.

The whole color scheme is meant to look nice and be easy to use, with soft colors that are still clear and stand out when needed. */
