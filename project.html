            <h2>What Makes This Treaty Different</h2>
            <pre>
What makes this treaty different is that it focused on land for settlement and farming aid but did not include as many provisions as later treaties. 
Disputes arose from unfulfilled promises, unlike later agreements like Treaty 6, which included more provisions such as health care.
